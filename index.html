        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
          We are a small group of tight-knit gamers that aspire to have fun while eliminating our
          online communities of toxicity as much as we can. FRC was founded by an unlikely group
          consisting of a father, his sons, co-workers and a few others that they had met online. We
          used to all center around the game "Counter Strike: Global Offensive" and we all enjoyed
          it. However, we were often lost with no plans, just playing for funny moments. We were
          akin to headless chicken running around, and thus FRC was born.<br /><br />Over the years
          we have brought in new members and branched out into different games. However, we all
          share the same love and mindset going from one game to another. After all, it's all about
          the game.<br /><br />We hope you find watching us as humourous as we do!
